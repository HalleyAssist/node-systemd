    - subject: Publish binaries with node pre-gyp
      hash: 1bfbbe05e54c980cadd488f0fdfb64b8e7075763
      body: |
        This uses the binaries built within the docker image build on the
        testing step to package with the release for use with node pre-gyp.

        Node pre-gyp will look for published artifacts for the given
        architecture before trying to build the module locally. This should
        allow projects relying on this dependency to build much faster,
        particularly on constrained environments.

        This prevents the target folder bloating the size of the `node_modules`

      hash: f6500378cf57eb15e969c3351ca903be39b1c5aa
      body: |
        Before it was synchronous, relying on opening a connection being a cheap
        operation, but this is really an anti-pattern as any I/O operation
        really needs to happen outside the main loop.

        This also improves the types to allow better type checking by the
        typescript compiler.

      body: >
        - Move unit control methods to the unit object: Even if they belong to
        the manager object in the systemd specification,

        they make more sense under the unit object, providing better UX

        - Pass bus as a rust function argument: Previously, the bus was obtained
        using `this()` in rust, which would

        force calling methods to use `function.call`
